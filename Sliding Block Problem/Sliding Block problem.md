## Problem setup
### Presuppositions
- all collisions are elastic
- no friction
- 1 dimensional plane
### scenario
- 2 cubes on with a wall to the left,
- The first cube begins at 0 velocity,
- The second cube begins with a negative velocity,
![[Projects/Completed/Puzzles and Problems/Sliding Block Problem/Sliding Block Problem(1).excalidraw]]
### Prove that
- The total number of collisions is equal to:
$$Collsions = trunc(\pi, n)$$


## Useful formulas
### Kinetic Energy
Kinetic Energy is conserved

Kinetic Energy
$$E_{K} = \frac{1}{2}m\times v^{2}$$
### Collisions
Velocity after elastic collision
$$v_{2}f=2⋅m1(m2+m1)v1i+(m2−m1)(m2+m1)v2i$$
Conservation of momentum
$$\displaylines{
m_{1}v_{1@t0} + m_{2}v_{2@t0}= m_{1}v_{1@t\infty} + m_{2}v_{2@t\infty}}

$$

## Constrains
For the scenario to end there must be no more collisions, for a collision to not be possible cube 1 must have a lower positive velocity than cube 2
## Example solve
$$\displaylines{
M_{1} =& 1 \\
M_{2} =& 100 \\
C =& 31 \\
	M _{2} = m_{1}
}$$

## Getting to a circle
Equation for Momentum ($P$)
$$P = mv $$





## Solving for $\pi$
$$r^{2}=\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)$$
$$A = \pi r^{2}$$
$$\therefore$$
$$\frac{A}{(x^{2}+ y^{2})}= \pi$$
